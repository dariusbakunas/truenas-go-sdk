        Creates a dataset/zvol.

        `volsize` is required for type=VOLUME and is supposed to be a multiple of the block size.
        `sparse` and `volblocksize` are only used for type=VOLUME.

        `encryption` when enabled will create an ZFS encrypted root dataset for `name` pool.
        There are 2 cases where ZFS encryption is not allowed for a dataset:
        1) Pool in question is GELI encrypted.
        2) If the parent dataset is encrypted with a passphrase and `name` is being created
          with a key for encrypting the dataset.

        `encryption_options` specifies configuration for encryption of dataset for `name` pool.
        `encryption_options.passphrase` must be specified if encryption for dataset is desired with a passphrase
        as a key.
        Otherwise a hex encoded key can be specified by providing `encryption_options.key`.
        `encryption_options.generate_key` when enabled automatically generates the key to be used
        for dataset encryption.

        It should be noted that keys are stored by the system for automatic locking/unlocking
        on import/export of encrypted datasets. If that is not desired, dataset should be created
        with a passphrase as a key.

        Query Pool Datasets with `query-filters` and `query-options`.

        We provide two ways to retrieve datasets. The first is a flat structure (default), where
        all datasets in the system are returned as separate objects which contain all data
        there is for their children. This retrieval type is slightly slower because of duplicates in each object.
        The second type is hierarchical, where only top level datasets are returned in the list. They contain all the
        children in the `children` key. This retrieval type is slightly faster.
        These options are controlled by the `query-options.extra.flat` attribute (default true).

        `paths` is a list of valid paths which are configured to be shared on this share.

        `networks` is a list of authorized networks that are allowed to access the share having format
        "network/mask" CIDR notation. If empty, all networks are allowed.

        `hosts` is a list of IP's/hostnames which are allowed to access the share. If empty, all IP's/hostnames are
        allowed.

        `alldirs` is a boolean value which when set indicates that the client can mount any subdirectories of the
        selected pool or dataset.

        Create an SMB Share.

        `purpose` applies common configuration presets depending on intended purpose.

        `timemachine` when set, enables Time Machine backups for this share.

        `ro` when enabled, prohibits write access to the share.

        `guestok` when enabled, allows access to this share without a password.

        `hostsallow` is a list of hostnames / IP addresses which have access to this share.

        `hostsdeny` is a list of hostnames / IP addresses which are not allowed access to this share. If a handful
        of hostnames are to be only allowed access, `hostsdeny` can be passed "ALL" which means that it will deny
        access to ALL hostnames except for the ones which have been listed in `hostsallow`.

        `acl` enables support for storing the SMB Security Descriptor as a Filesystem ACL.

        `streams` enables support for storing alternate datastreams as filesystem extended attributes.

        `fsrvp` enables support for the filesystem remote VSS protocol. This allows clients to create
        ZFS snapshots through RPC.

        `shadowcopy` enables support for the volume shadow copy service.

        `auxsmbconf` is a string of additional smb4.conf parameters not covered by the system's API.
